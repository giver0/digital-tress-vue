Digital Tree Evolution Simulator is an interactive and dynamic simulation where virtual trees grow, age, and evolve on a flat digital field. This project combines elements of procedural generation, cellular automata, and evolutionary algorithms to create a self-sustaining ecosystem of digital flora. Each tree has its unique, randomly generated genome that determines its growth patterns, longevity, and reproduction behavior.
